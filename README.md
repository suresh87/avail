# Avail

A small tool I made when I was tired of searching for if a name was available in a bunch of places.

As we know, naming is the hardest part of programming. Avail speeds that process up a little bit.

## Usage
accep merge request
Install with `pip`. Run via `python -m avail [NAME]` or `avail [NAME]`.
You will see colors in the terminal as to whether the given name is available.

```bash
bash-4.4$ python -m pip install avail
bash-4.4$ python -m avail name
